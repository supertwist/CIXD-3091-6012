**prompt:** How could a twisted LEGO brick be developed further as a design concept?

**Result:** 

2️⃣ Core concept: Twisted LEGO Brick

What it is
A LEGO brick whose top and bottom faces are rotated slightly off-axis (e.g. 3°–10°), creating a subtle torsion through the body of the brick.
	•	Still recognizable as LEGO
	•	Still stackable (depending on version)
	•	But visually never fully aligned

Think: a LEGO brick caught mid-rotation.

3️⃣ Ways to develop the Twisted Brick (design directions)

🧱 Direction A: Micro-Twist Brick (System-Friendly)
Form
	•	Twist angle: 2°–5°
	•	Studs and anti-studs still snap
	•	Misalignment is felt more than seen

Why it works
	•	Can still be stacked vertically
	•	Creates gradual spiral walls when repeated
	•	Feels like LEGO “almost behaving”

Best framing

Extending the LEGO grid without breaking it.

⸻

🧱 Direction B: Stack-to-Twist System (Accumulated Rotation)
Form
	•	Bottom stays grid-aligned
	•	Top rotated noticeably (8°–15°)
	•	Side faces stretch diagonally

Why it’s interesting
	•	Clear visual tension
	•	Looks like the brick is under stress
	•	Less about stacking, more sculptural

Best use
	•	Single objects
	•	Display / exhibition pieces
