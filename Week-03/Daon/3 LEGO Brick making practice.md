**Note:** Understand LEGO bricks' structure and Practice making with a 3D program

I don't know how to make lego brick with Fusion, so I searched a tutorial on making LEGO on YouTube.

**YouTube Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peC5FAOhJk8&t=269s

**LEGO Brick reference:** https://www.bartneck.de/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/LEGO-Brick-Dimensions-Measurements.pdf

**Result:** Now I can make a 2X2 LEGO piece!
