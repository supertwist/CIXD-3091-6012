**NOTE** To create a wider variety of combinations with my LEGO bricks, I changed the original concept - twisted bricks.

Inspired by an existing LEGO piece(part 4733) that uses 1x1 connectors with studs on all sides,
I explored ways to create more diverse combined forms. This led me to the idea of **adding studs onto a slope.**
