**Note:**  
This is a really risky experiment I'm attempting! I'm attempting to build an AI agent that can get notes from me as I think of them, organize, and can automagically send me to-do lists. The concept comes from an AI expert I follow on Substack, but rather that following his instructions manually, I'm asking Claude Code to do it for me AND to substitute his recommended tech stack with open source elements that can run locally on my computer. 

**Model:**  
Claude Code, Opus, 1/24/2026

**Prompt:**  
Prompt for Claude Code:

The goal is to build a working system based on this plan, but using a different tech stack, most of which is running locally.  
'/Users/james/GIT/Claude/Brain2/Second Brain Build Guide.pdf'

Use Opus model.

Using that plan as a starting point, replace the tech stack as follows:

Instead of Slack, use Discord, specifically this private channel:  
https://discord.com/channels/1258460225409646703/1464636990548086930  
Provide step-by-step configuration instructions if you can't do it yourself. Ask for appropriate permissions. 

Instead of Claude, use Ollama, which is running locally. The localhost address is:   http://localhost:11434
Ask for appropriate permissions. 

Instead of Notion, use Obsidian. It is installed locally, and it's file storage is here:  
'/Users/james/Library/Application Support/obsidian'
Provide step-by-step configuration instructions if you can't do it yourself. Ask for appropriate permissions. 

Instead of Zapier, use n8n. I'll need help installing and cofiguring it locally. Instructions for installation are here: https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/ 
Provide step-by-step configuration instructions if you can't do it yourself. Ask for appropriate permissions. 

**Result:**  
If it works, I'll demo in class!
