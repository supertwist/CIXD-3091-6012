**Note:**  
get in the habit of domcumenting all of the questions you pose to AIs.

**Prompt:**  
Provide a table that briefly describes Anthropic's models; first column = model name; second column = description with an emphasison best use case; third column equals pros; fourth column = cons; fifth column = usage cost.

**Citation:**  
Claude Code, Sonnet 4.5, 1/23/2026

**Response:**  
Here's a table describing Anthropic's Claude models:                                                                                          
| Model Name | Description & Best Use Case | Pros | Cons | Usage Cost (per MTok) |
|------------|----------------------------|------|------|---------------------|
| **Claude Opus 4.5** | Most capable model for complex reasoning, advanced coding, and research tasks. Best for: cutting-edge AI applications requiring maximum intelligence. | Highest intelligence, best at complex analysis, superior coding capabilities, longest context understanding | Higher cost, slower response times | Input: $15<br>Output: $75 |
| **Claude Sonnet 4.5** | Balanced intelligence and speed for production applications. Best for: sophisticated coding, data analysis, and complex workflows requiring efficiency. | Strong reasoning, fast responses, excellent coding, good balance of capability/cost | Not quite as capable as Opus for most challenging tasks | Input: $3<br>Output: $15 |
| **Claude Sonnet 3.5** | Previous generation balanced model. Best for: general-purpose tasks, conversational AI, content generation. | Reliable performance, well-tested, good for most tasks, cost-effective | Superseded by Sonnet 4.5 in capabilities | Input: $3<br>Output: $15 |
| **Claude Haiku 3.5** | Fastest and most cost-effective model. Best for: high-volume tasks, simple queries, real-time applications, basic automation. | Lowest cost, fastest responses, efficient for simple tasks | Limited reasoning depth, not suitable for complex problems | Input: $0.80<br>Output: $4 |
| **Claude Opus 3** | Earlier flagship model. Best for: legacy applications still optimized for it. | Strong performance for its generation | Superseded by Opus 4.5 and Sonnet 4.5 | Input: $15<br>Output: $75 |

## Notes

- Costs are approximate and may vary by API usage tier and region
- All models support 200K token context windows
- Opus 4.5 is the current frontier model (released late 2025)
- Choose Haiku for speed, Sonnet for balance, Opus for maximum capability
