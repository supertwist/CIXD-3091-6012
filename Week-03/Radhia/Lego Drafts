## LEGO Re-Design Concept Overview:
I am exploring the creation of a **non-conventional LEGO piece** that moves beyond standard rectangular geometry by **incorporating curved or angled forms**.  
This concept is **inspired by LEGO Flower Bouquet sets**, which demonstrate how expressive, organic shapes can still exist within the LEGO system.

---

## Goals:
1. **Non-Rectangular Geometry:** Introduce organic forms like curves, arcs, or angled pieces.  
2. **System Compatibility:** Ensure compatibility with existing LEGO pieces, keeping clutch power and functional interlocking intact.  
3. **Creative Expression:** Enable more creative and sculptural builds while maintaining practicality.
