+ Homework: watch [Git and Github for Poets](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/git-and-github-for-poets) - watch parts 1-4; those are the basics. The rest of the videos are pretty advanced, and geared to folks writing lots of code (we aren't.) But the eighth video, [GitHub Pages](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/git-and-github-for-poets/git/1-fundamentals/8-pages) shows how to use GitHub as a FREE host for a web site. That could be useful to you if you want to create a portfolio or microsite.
