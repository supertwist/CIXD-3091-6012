**How is this page formatted?** 

This isn't a plain vanilla .TXT file or a MS-Word .DOCX - it uses **markdown** to format the content and uses the .MD file extension. Markdown is a little like .HTML, but much simpler. I'll be using it a lot for the documents I create for this class. Periodically, I'll give you written assignments that you will include in this repo, and any notes or research you do for assignments should be captured here as well (boosts your grade when I can see your research and thought process!) You can save those texts as .TXT, but if you want additional visual clarity (readability), here is a [quick start guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax); and for reference here's a [cheat sheet](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for adding markdown formatting.

**Recommended Reading/Watching**
+ ["Enshittification," by Cory Doctorow.](https://craphound.com/category/enshittification/) - great thesis on *why* the internet (and tech products in general) have become so awful. And, also a call to arms against the broligarchs.
+ ["Jugaad Innovation," by Navi Radjou, Jaideep Prabhu, and Simone Ahuja](https://jugaadinnovation.com/) - (I'm still in the middle of this, but great read..) discusses non-western approaches to creative problem solving with limited material resources and a wealth of cultural resources. 
+ ["Think Wrong," by  John Bielenberg, Mike Burn, Greg Galle, and Elizabeth Evitts Dickinson](https://www.thinkwrongbook.com/) - a cookbook of strategies for discovering non-obvious solutions.
+ [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) - a web site that organizes an extensive library of videos that introduces coding to visual artist-types like you and me. Daniel Shiffman is my hero. And, in the context of this class, the best place to start is his ["GitHub for Poets" tutorials](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/git-and-github-for-poets). He 'splains it WAAAAAY better than I do.
+ There's also a 3-sh hour tutorial on GitHub in [LinkedIn Leaning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?account=74651410&forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Flearning-git-and-github-23011330%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3DFwtRiiLHSHynZUCLlqLKgQ%253D%253D)
+ [Tom Sachs' 10 Bullets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49p1JVLHUos) - How to work TO CODE. Lots of relevent principles for this class, and professional practice in general.
+ [Inside My Studio: Tom Sachs ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td7LrVY74Gg) - Breaking character, Sachs talks sincerely about his studio practice. His comments about hot glue guns really drive home the value of RAPID prototyping vs trying to get everything *perfect.* 
+ [An Idea – Things My Mom Taught Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0LqgJgMUoQ) - Yes, more Tom Sachs... and his mom! Great demo of working with found resources.

+ [LLM deep dive video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI). It's a couple of hours long, but it doesn't get too technical, and demystifies the technology. After I watched it, I realized how much of genAI is really just Mechanical Turk parlor tricks.
