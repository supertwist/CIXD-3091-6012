**Recommended Reading**
+ ["Enshittification," by Cory Doctorow.](https://craphound.com/category/enshittification/) - great thesis on *why* the internet (and tech products in general) have become so awful. And, also a call to arms against the broligarchs.
+ ["Jugaad Innovation," by Navi Radjou, Jaideep Prabhu, and Simone Ahuja](https://jugaadinnovation.com/) - (I'm still in the middle of this, but great read..) discusses non-western approaches to creative problem solving with limited material resources and a wealth of cultural resources. 
+ ["Think Wrong," by  John Bielenberg, Mike Burn, Greg Galle, and Elizabeth Evitts Dickinson](https://www.thinkwrongbook.com/) - a cookbook of strategies for discovering non-obvious solutions.
+ [Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) - a web site that organizes an extensive library of videos that introduces coding to visual artist-types like you and me. Daniel Shiffman is my hero. And, in the context of this class, the best place to start is his ["GitHub for Poets" tutorials](https://thecodingtrain.com/tracks/git-and-github-for-poets). He 'splains it WAAAAAY better than I do.
