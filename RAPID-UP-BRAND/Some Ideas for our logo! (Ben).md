Hi y'all! It's Ben. I was playing aorund with some logo designs over break to (potentially) make into stickers at some point.
The ones I have included below were from when I was playing off of the rapid/rabbit idea- thinking more just about overall vibe than any serious detail (the center logo, the text, etc.) 

I think it would be great to work collectively on a design for 'Rapid Up', and play around with what that could be/what it would look like. Thoughts?
