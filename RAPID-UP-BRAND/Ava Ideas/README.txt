Obviously I love rabbits 
also as Ben pointed out it matches the wrap it/rapid/rabbid/rabbit thing we have going on 
further than that I like how rabbits are known for being fast, so it matches that dimension of time symbollically
and additionally from a greater perspective, they're prey animals made and destroyed quickly, kinda like prototypes...
