Obviously I love rabbits 
also as Ben pointed out it matches the wrap it/rapid/rabbid/rabbit thing we have going on 
further than that I like how rabbits are known for being fast, so it matches that dimension of time symbollically
and additionally from a greater perspective, they're prey animals made and destroyed quickly, kinda like prototypes...

so I propose something like these:
IDEA 1) idk a tall scribbly rabbit seems hip 
IDEA 2) emphasizes iterations 
IDEA 3) ideas are always evolving and also to me give a sense of future building (the sun behind it is optional)
