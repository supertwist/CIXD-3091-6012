Lego Re-Design Concept: SEE Lego sketches Folder:
I am exploring the creation of a non-conventional LEGO 
piece that moves beyond standard rectangular geometry by 
incorporating curved or angled forms. This concept is 
inspired by LEGO flower bouquet sets, which demonstrate how expressive, organic shapes 
can still exist within the LEGO system. The goal is to ensure that the piece remains fully 
compatible with existing LEGO bricks, maintaining functional connections while allowing for more creative and sculptural forms.
