### Key Conflicting Information:
1. **Paris** is almost universally included, but **Travellers Worldwide** emphasizes **New York City** in its place as a major destination.
2. **London** appears in most rankings; however, **themost10.com** overlooks it in favor of exotic locations like the **Maldives**.
3. **Bali** is loved for its natural appeal, but **Tripadvisor Reveals 2025's Must-Visit Destinations** omits it entirely.
4. **Crete** and **Santorini** show up in isolated lists, reflecting a preference for niche Mediterranean destinations.
5. **Tokyo** and **Maldives** are featured in **themost10.com**, but none of the other sources included them in their top 5.
