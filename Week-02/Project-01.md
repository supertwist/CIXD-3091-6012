# Build a custom Lego brick.

**Goal:**
A novel, expressive, repeatable sculptural element that extends the vocabulary of Lego bricks. Think about the Lego brick you always wanted but never existed...

**Requirements**
1. Must be able to connect to a standard lego brick, and conversely bricks should be able to connect to it; so you'll need *at least one stud* (outgoing connection,) and *at least one spot for an incoming stud.* Everything else is up to you - have fun, **get weird.**
2. Total brick volume should fit within 2" x 2" x 2".

**Process:**
+ this week: imagine, research, design, create a model
+ next week: 
  + print one, test with authentic Lego bricks to ensure your design works. Fix/refine/iterate as-needed.
  + Once you have a tested brick, print 9 more.
  + Build a small sculpure with it. Photograph your sculpture. Then disassemble.
  + Wash/rinse/repeat 9 more times.
  + At the end, you will have documented 10 possible sculptures.
+ week after: present in class

**Documentation**
In GitHub, create a sub-directory in Week-04 with your name, and upload your 10 pictures.
