# Week 2 Agenda
+ quick visit to the sculpture studio:
  + meet Daniel Jonas
  + discuss resources available
  + do's and don'ts
  + "Things My Mom Taught Me"
+ review creating directories in GitHub
+ review skills, form teams
+ AI lecture
+ AltLego assignment  
 
+ A Copilot exercise:
  + think about a research question that compares *some things,* for example:
    + what are top ten strangest Lego bricks?
    + what are top five easiest CAD tools for beginners?
    + what are most common generative AI tools?
  + you want 5 credible online sources for each of *the things.* 
  + now think about what criteria will help you select from those results
    + (ex: lego) how complicated is the brick?
    + (ex: AD) how long will it take to learn this program?
    + (ex: AI) what kinds of probrems is this tool best at solving reliably?
  + you want Copilot to check for consistency across the sources
  + you want the results returned in a table format (it will be in markdown)
  + copy the result into a new file /week-02/yourname/research.md   

+ Build a prompt that will jump‑start the process of re‑designing the LEGO brick! Post prompts and research to GitHub by Jan 27.
