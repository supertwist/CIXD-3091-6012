prompt: Compare Blender, Maya, 3ds Max, ZBrush, and SketchUp in a single table focused on how easy it is to edit an existing LEGO 3D model, including similarities, differences, and clickable source links.

result: The comparison shows that 3ds Max and Blender are the most effective tools for editing existing LEGO 3D models, with 3ds Max excelling in non‑destructive parametric edits and Blender offering the strongest free workflow, while Maya is precise but heavier, SketchUp is limited for dense meshes, and ZBrush is least suitable due to its organic sculpting focus.
