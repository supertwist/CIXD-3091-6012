prompt: Compare Blender, Maya, 3ds Max, ZBrush, and SketchUp in a single table focused on how easy it is to edit an existing LEGO 3D model, including similarities, differences, and clickable source links.

result: The comparison shows that 3ds Max and Blender are the most effective tools for editing existing LEGO 3D models, with 3ds Max excelling in non‑destructive parametric edits and Blender offering the strongest free workflow, while Maya is precise but heavier, SketchUp is limited for dense meshes, and ZBrush is least suitable due to its organic sculpting focus.




## 🧩 Editing a Pre‑Existing LEGO 3D Model

| Software | Ease | Similarities | Key Differences | Sources |
|---------|------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| Blender | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | Polygon editing, Booleans, OBJ/FBX/STL imports | Free/open-source; strong hard-surface LEGO editing | [1][2][3] |
| Autodesk Maya | ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ | Polygon editing and precision transforms | Subscription-only; weaker non-destructive history | [4][5][6] |
| Autodesk 3ds Max | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Polygon modeling and Booleans | Modifier stack enables non-destructive LEGO edits | [7][8][9] |
| ZBrush | ⭐⭐☆☆☆ | Imports and edits meshes | Organic sculpting; poor LEGO precision | [10][11][12] |
| SketchUp | ⭐⭐⭐☆☆ | Layout-based modeling | Explode-to-edit; weak for dense LEGO meshes | [13][14][15] |
