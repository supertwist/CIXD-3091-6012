This file is to collect some excess ideas from the week:

Contrasting the bricolage idea: the innovation center had a guest lecturer come in, Netrice Gaskins, who was very eccentric, and developed the idea 
of "technovernacular creativity" which is a more culture focused idea. As an artist, she has done large scale collaborative artworks between her and 
AI, which could be interesting for you to look at, especially since she was kinda ahead of the curve on that one. But anyways, basically it talks about 
scavenging and using the materials around you, not as a revolutionary choice but as a normal part of everyday life, and the culture and innovation that
is born out of it. Her lens is also more specifically applied to STEM education and how to use the ideas similar to bricollage as a way to encourage 
more students of color to be interested in STEM. I remember her talking about how this “practice” of using found objects shaped the sound of hip-hop and 
street culture.
