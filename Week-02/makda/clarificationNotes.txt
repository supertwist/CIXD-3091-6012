📝 How I Decided What Counts as “Best”
To determine which adaptations qualified as the “best,” I used four objective criteria, all aligned with your requirement that each entry include sales‑related “success” info and multiple reliable sources:
1. Documented, measurable game‑sales or engagement impact
Shows were selected if they produced clear, verifiable changes in game behavior—e.g.:

Sales spikes (e.g., Fallout’s +7,500%, Witcher’s +554%).
Chart position jumps (e.g., Fallout #87→#5, TLOU #36→#11).
Massive player‑count surges (e.g., Cyberpunk +1M DAU; Witcher 100k CCU).

If a show could not demonstrate meaningful post‑release game impact with reliable data, it was excluded from the initial top 3.
2. Presence of at least three reputable, industry‑grade sources
Selections were limited to adaptations with high‑quality data from places like:
GamesIndustry.biz, Circana/NPD, PC Gamer, Ars Technica, IGN, VentureBeat, Bloomberg summaries.
This ensured each row had solid, multi‑sourced evidence.
3. Industry recognition as standout adaptations
These five shows are widely acknowledged in trade reporting as major cross‑media successes (even when sales impact varies).
Their inclusion reflects both cultural prominence and availability of quantifiable effects.
4. Ability to explain and reconcile conflicting data
“Best” also meant the chosen adaptations had enough reliable, traceable data to reconcile regional/timeframe/metric differences—necessary for the table's “conflict” column.
Why Arcane and The Witcher were later additions
You asked for two more, so I added:

The Witcher: enormous, well‑documented sales impact → objectively belongs in any “best” list.
Arcane: critically acclaimed and culturally huge; not a sales success, but its importance as an adaptation warranted inclusion under your “add 2 more” request.
