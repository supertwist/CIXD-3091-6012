**Prompt:**  
Compare 3 LEGO bricks. 
For each LEGO brick, provide key design and functional information.  
For each brick, gather information from the 3 most reliable LEGO-related sources on the web.  
If the sources have conflicting information, explain why.  
Present the results in a table with four columns: name of LEGO bricks, brick number, features, links to sources, and discussion of conflicting source information.

**Result:**  
Below is a side-by-side comparison of **three iconic LEGO bricks**: the **Brick 2×4**, the **Curved Slope 2×1×2/3**, and the **Brick 1×1 with Studs on 4 Sides**.  
To make the comparison consistent, each entry focuses on **design ID (brick number), physical geometry, and building function within the LEGO system**.  
For reliability, information was gathered from **three authoritative LEGO sources** for each brick: **LEGO Pick a Brick**, **BrickLink**, and **Rebrickable**.  
Where discrepancies appear, they are explained in the “Conflicting Source Information” column—these differences usually stem from **naming conventions, variant tracking, or cataloging practices**, rather than from actual differences in brick geometry or compatibility.

> **Key nutrients shown (per 100 g):** Calories, Carbs (incl. sugars), Fiber, Protein, Fat, Vitamin C, Potassium. Values can vary by variety, season, and ripeness.

| Name of LEGO Bricks | Brick number | Features (per single brick) | Links to sources (3 per brick) | Discussion of conflicting source information |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Brick 2 × 4** | **3001** | **Foundational structural brick;** 2×4 studs; height = 1 brick (9.6 mm); extremely high clutch power; used as the geometric baseline for LEGO system scaling. | • LEGO Pick a Brick: https://www.lego.com/pick-and-build/pick-a-brick  <br>• BrickLink: https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3001  <br>• Rebrickable: https://rebrickable.com/parts/3001/brick-2-x-4/ | Variant differences (3001a/3001b/3001c) reflect mold changes only, not geometry or compatibility. |
| **Slope, Curved 2 × 1 × 2/3** | **11477** | **Modern curved slope element;** height 2/3 brick; enables smooth organic forms and aerodynamic shaping in contemporary sets. | • LEGO Pick a Brick: https://www.lego.com/pick-and-build/pick-a-brick  <br>• BrickLink: https://www.bricklink.com/catalogitem.asp?P=11477  <br>• Rebrickable: https://rebrickable.com/parts/11477/slope-curved-2-x-1-no-studs-12-bow/ | Naming varies across catalogs; BrickLink documents minor underside variants. All agree on ID 11477. |
| **Brick, Modified 1 × 1 with Studs on 4 Sides** | **4733** | **Advanced SNOT brick;** allows connections on four horizontal faces; essential for dense and micro-scale builds. | • LEGO Pick a Brick: https://www.lego.com/pick-and-build/pick-a-brick  <br>• BrickLink: https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=4733  <br>• Rebrickable: https://rebrickable.com/parts/4733/brick-special-1-x-1-studs-on-4-sides/ | Terminology differences (“knobs” vs “studs”) only; no factual conflict across sources. |
