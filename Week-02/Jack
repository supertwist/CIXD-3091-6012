| **Peppermint Oil (Natural Repellent)** | **Environmental:** Peppermint oil is low‑toxicity and avoids chemical pesticides, but must be reapplied frequently due to rapid evaporation, increasing resource use. **Moral/Ethical:** Considered humane since it does not harm mice; however, its limited effectiveness may lead to prolonged infestations, indirectly prompting harsher measures. | • (turn1search7) • (turn1search9) • (turn1search8) | **Conflict:** Some sources say peppermint oil helps as part of integrated pest management; others say it fails quickly due to dissipation and mouse habituation. Differences come from oil purity, application method, and short‑ vs long‑term evaluation. |
| **Ultrasonic Repellents** | **Environmental:** No chemicals; small electricity use; may affect non‑target wildlife. **Moral/Ethical:** Humane since no physical harm is done, but inducing prolonged stress can be ethically debated. | • (turn1search1) • (turn1search4) • (turn1search3) | **Conflict:** Some report short‑term reduction; most conclude long‑term failure due to habituation and obstacles. Conflicts come from differing device quality, testing environments, and whether measuring initial reaction vs sustained deterrence. |
| **Humane Live Traps** | **Environmental:** Reusable but relocation can impact ecosystems. **Moral/Ethical:** Humane if traps are checked frequently and releases are safe; some argue relocation still causes stress or harm. | • (turn1search13) • (turn1search14) • (turn1search18) | **Conflict:** Some call humane traps the only ethical option; others say relocation causes suffering. Differences arise from trap design, release practices, and ethical frameworks (animal rights vs harm‑minimization). |
