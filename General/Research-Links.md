# Research Links

Feel free to add links to share with the class - just add them to the top. And be sure so include a sentence or two (or more!) that explain why it is of interest.

+ [Great essay by Cory Doctorow in the **Guardian** on why AI will fail](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/18/tech-ai-bubble-burst-reverse-centaur)

+ [**How many tokens...?**](https://tiktokenizer.vercel.app/)

+ [list of **models** available in Ollama](https://ollama.com/library)

+ [Claude CoWork](https://claude.com/resources/tutorials/claude-cowork-a-research-preview) is in development mode but looks *really* intersting. It's basically Claude Code, but **not** in a terminal.

+ I've been looking for a simple markdown editor; [MarkText](https://marktext.me/) is free, open source, and cross-platform.

+ 3D printed **foam???** [Build](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSzRmLDkYIG/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==) and vendor, TPU air by [Siraya Tech](https://siraya.tech/products/flex-tpu-air-65a-82a-foaming-flexible-filament)

+ Easier **support removal** [settings](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQlzZxkk916/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==).

+ **Cleaner prints,** at least for PLA [settings tutorial](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSuFTfcDntB/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==). 

+ Better **TPU printing** [tutorial with settings](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSxavwMjame/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==). Again on the IG.

+ Better **translucency for 3D-printed objects** [quick tutorial](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQ66m5sDWka/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==). On the IG, and gives example of why you'd want to use a different nozzle, and change temp and speed settings.

+ [**Claude Code for Non-Programmers**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?account=74651410&forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fclaude-code-for-non-programmers-automating-daily-tasks%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3DDJ3DR2UjSQum7iG2LAYrew%253D%253D) - very short intro to Claude Code, which runs from a terminal window, but this cuts through a lot of complexity to get up-and-running in less than an hour. The examples are clear and concrete, but beware: in my opinion it doesn't sufficiently warn you about a couple of pitfalls. Always restrict your actions to a specific directory BECAUSE otherwise you risk overwriting important files on your computer that could brick it. And it assumes that all the output Claude generates is correct; do NOT assume that - you should spend some time validating the answers it gives.

+ 3D printing is too slow for producing at scale - typically large runs (of plastic parts) need to be injection molded (expensive setup!) This might be an interesting middle-ground: [**SALTGATOR**](https://saltgator.com/).

+ [Quick totuorial for **splitting large models** in slicer:](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQV-7bBAtjC/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ==) on IG.
