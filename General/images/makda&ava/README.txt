Rapidly prototyped sleds on the snowday

On Sunday we were out playing in the snow and wanted to sled but we didnt have any but wanted some quick! So we took some styrofoam posters from GWSB (sorry), put two holes in the top, and strung some material through to make handles. We reinforced the holes with a little packing tape and scribbled on the bottoms with spray paint and expo markers. We included some pics of the materials used and process, which overall was prob 20 min? rapid, just using whatever we found around, literally. ! <3
