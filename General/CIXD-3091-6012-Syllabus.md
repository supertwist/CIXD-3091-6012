### Catalog Description
Investigation of prototyping as a method for testing and communicating initial design assumptions and creating platforms for participatory response; refinement of associated fabrication skills. Materials fee.
**Prerequisites** CIXD 2091 and CIXD 2111.
**Units** 3

### Semester Approach to the Course
The world is expensive! We'll consider how to take advantage of limited available resources: constraints can supercharge creativity.

It's easy to fall into the same old routine and settle for obvious solutions. We'll develop skills that break you out of old, easy habits and assumptions that lead to more original solutions.
  
It's easy to design in the abstract, but coming up with solutions for REAL people is... messy! We'll develop client engagement skills by working on live projects with real clients and their stakeholders.

Clients don't want to just hear ideas, they want to see concrete things that can be poked, pushed, marked up, beat up, torn down, etc. We'll spend time in the fab lab broadening your skills at MAKING THINGS.

Everything comes to an end. What is the lifecycle of the thing you've made? Does it have a shelf life? What comes after? Rather than cradle-to-grave, we'll consider a cradle-to-cradle mindset that encourages sustainability.

### Course Content
CIXD 3091/6012 covers:
+ How to think with your eyes and hands before you touch a computer.
+ How to play nice with others (collaborate with colleagues.)
+ How to create ORIGINAL work with genIA.
+ How to make things with LASERS!
+ How to 3D print things.
+ How to engage clients and pitch potential solutions.

### Course Learning Outcomes
CIXD 3091/6012 satisfies the following GWU Corcoran Design Program learning outcomes:

**Creativity and Design Process** (CDP) - Students will create inventive and appropriate design solutions using a variety of approaches, knowledges, and skills—including intuition, ideation, iteration, reason, research, and strategy.

**Design Impact (IMP)** - Students will responsibly and respectfully engage communities/places and their histories in the process of developing design-based responses; they will assess design solutions with a focus on their environmental and social impacts over their lifecycle.

**Design Tools, Techniques, and Skills** (TTS) - Students will be proficient in design techniques/technologies and cultivate the capacity to build practical/technical skills as approaches/tools change.

**Professional Design Practices** (PDP) - Students will be aware of the approaches and strategies for building a sustainable creative practice; they will demonstrate design professionalism through effective communication, persuasive presentations, organizational understanding, design strategy, and self-reflective approaches to working with and guiding the work of others.

These learning outcomes are dimensions of every assignment, but particularly for out three client engagements - these client engagements are really the mile-markers. At the end of each engagement we’ll take some time in class to discuss how you performed own each of these dimensions. I’ll expect each of you to be able to speak articulately about how each of these outcomes was reflected in the project. So for example, on any client engagement, I might ask you:

+ What interesting things did you discover in your research that took you in an unexpected direction? (CDP)
+ Did you refine your solution such that it might be scaled sustainably? (IMP)
+ Did you bootstrap any new skills to pull off your prototype? (TTS)
+ How well did you ‘hear’ the stakeholders? In the final pitch, was there a disconnect? (PDP) 

You will be assessed by how well you can speak to each of those dimensions at the end of as project.

### Student Competencies
By the end of CIXD 3091/6012 students will be able to:

+ Contribute to a GitHub repository
+ Build interactive wireframes in Figma
+ Prep files for laser engraving and cutting in Illustrator (we’ll touch on some more esoteric capabilities that aren’t covered in the basic laser training)
+ Use the 3D scanners
+ Create basic models for FDM printing Fusion 360
+ Prep files for FDM printing using Orca slicer (like the lasers, we’ll touch on some more esoteric capabilities that aren’t covered in the basic laser training)
+ Build useful prompts in Gemini
+ Capture useful info from stakeholders to solve problems 
+ Create compelling presentations that convey your solutions to clients

## Activities, Processes, and Assignments
We’ll start the semester with some specific skill-building exercises (3D scanning, advanced 3D printing, advanced laser engraving and cutting). Then, we’re going to work on three live projects for real clients. Each of these will be three week sprints, where we exercise your skills such that you get progressively better through practice. By the third client project you’ll be much better at (for example) collecting stakeholder input than you were on the first client. 

Getting proficient (at anything) takes repeated practice over an extended period of time. If you sit on a rock long enough, it will hatch.

### Course Workload (per week)
**In-class duration:** 4.5 hours
**Out-of-class work:** 9 hours

### Course Format 
CIXD 3091/6012 is a studio course; it is structured around the creative interpretation of a given scenario into designed output. Instruction is conveyed via short presentations/demonstrations, in-class/field exercises, and individual and group review.

### Course Resources 
The GWU Corcoran offers dedicated resources/spaces for: cardboard, ceramics, computing, digital fabrication, drawing, mold making, painting, photography, printmaking, and shopwork. Visit corcoran.gwu.edu/open-studios for access protocol and contact the GWU Corcoran Studio Manager, Kaitlin Jencso (kjencso@gwu.edu), with direct inquiries.
 
CIXD 3091/6012 students make full use of the following GWU Corcoran facilities/open studios:
 
**Fabrication Lab**
This studio is operating as a service bureau as well as a hands-on open studio for laser cutters and 3D printers. Students must receive training by studio staff before using the equipment in the lab or submitting jobs to the Service Bureau. Jobs submitted to the Service Bureau are typically completed in 24-48 hours but can take longer during periods of heavy use.
 
**Large Format Printing**
A web form/service bureau is used for large format printing. No large format printers are accessible by students. The service bureau is the only way to acquire large format prints. Turn-around time for the service bureau is less than 5 days, with potential delays during times of heavy requests. Visit [corcoran.gwu.edu/open-studios](corcoran.gwu.edu/open-studios) for submission details.
 
**Equipment Check-Out**
The GW Corcoran provides many types of creative equipment for student use. Students should explore their options with the Flagg Basement Checkout, through the Exhibitions Coordinator, and associated with the Design program.

For more information–on everything from making individual training arrangements to researching additional resources–refer to [corcoran.gwu.edu/our-spaces](corcoran.gwu.edu/our-spaces).

### Course Supplies
Students are expected to purchase assignment-specific design supplies throughout CIXD 3091/6012. While there are always work-arounds, students should budget for +/- $500 in course-specific material expenses. Students with financial hardships should discuss alternatives with the instructor. Detailed purchase lists are provided with individual assignments; a general purchase list is provided below.
 
**Tools**
You must keep a notebook and pens with you at ALL times. **BE PREPARED.**

If you don’t have a 3-button mouse, get one! I promise, if you don’t already use one for CAD modeling, it will be a life-changing experience. [Recommended, about $25](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Bluetooth-Lightweight-Customizable-Easy-Switch/dp/B0BT48897L/).

If you don’t already have accounts for these apps, you’ll need:

+ [GitHub](https://github.com/)
+ [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
+ [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://it.gwu.edu/adobe-creative-cloud)
+ [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/education/home)

Other software we’ll use:

+ [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
+ [Copilot](https://it.gwu.edu/microsoft-copilot)
+ [Orca](https://www.orcaslicer.com/)

Not ‘required’ but highly, highly recommended:
[Digital calipers, about $30](https://www.amazon.com/NEIKO-01401A-Measurement-Conversions-Millimeters/dp/B076DS19WQ/)
 
**Texts**
Specific readings will be provided as physical copies and .PDF. And I’m always finding new material of interest and will share with the class as it comes up.

### Course Expectations of Students
Showing up on time to every class, submitting all assignments on time, participating in class, checking off all the boxes will guarantee… a ‘B.’ To get an ‘A’ you have to take big risks… if your going to fail, FAIL SPECTACULARLY. You’ll learn so much more failing spectacularly than playing it safe. And school is the safe space to have those failures. 

CIXD 3091/6012 students are expected to be active participants, discursive and productive. Students are asked to arrive promptly at each class prepared for the relevant in-class activities and exercises.
 
CIXD 3091/6012 is structured around regular assignments. Individual assignments describe the case-specific submission expectations. Generally, students share assignment submissions with the class. Students are required to pin-up physical work or screenshare digital work. All work must be pinned up and/or uploaded by the start of the deadline class. In this class in particular, we’ll be working with actual clients - they love to get their hands on REAL things.
 
Regardless of format, all student work must be submitted (for purposes of assessment, archiving, and outreach) as formatted digital packages. Students must upload digital files (computational originals or photographic documentation of the physical) of their work to GitHub.
 
Students are evaluated based on public presentations, but grades are withheld until the final digital files are saved in GitHub.

### Course Schedule
The CIXD 3091/6012 course schedule is subject to refinement and reconfiguration in response to participant feedback, visitor availability, and contextual reassessment. Find any updates posted to Blackboard.

**Typical Schedule**
+ 1 hour: JAMES SPEWS!!!
+ .5 hour: quick exercise

## Assessment 
The Design Program at the GWU Corcoran tracks student success via five assessment criteria/measures or learning outcomes: design criticism and vocabulary; creativity and design process; design impact; design tools, techniques, and skills; and professional design practices. CIXD 3091/6012 is responsible for providing content that teaches Creativity and Design Process (CDP), Design Impact (IMP), Design Tools, Techniques, and Skills (TTS), and Professional Design Practices (PDP) . CIXD 3091/6012 activities, processes, and assignments prepare and prompt students to demonstrate competencies that align with one or more of the assessment criteria/measures or learning outcomes for which the course is responsible.

### How Students Demonstrate Learning
**Per Class Assignments (30%)**
Students create new work for each class. The per-class assignments are incremental steps in the development of a culminating product.
 
**Phase Reviews (60%)**
Students present their cumulative work from each phase in a formal review.
 
**Attendance/Participation (10%)**
Students are expected to attend class and engage respectfully with peers and faculty/staff. Class participation can take on many forms, from showing up prepared to verbally asking thoughtful questions to listening with an open mind.

### Assessment Matrix
CIXD 3091/6012 is evaluated overall according to the following:

| Assignment                | Point Value Per Assignment | Number of Assignments | Total Percent of Final Grade |
|---------------------------|:--------------------------:|:---------------------:|:----------------------------:|
| Per Class Assignments     | 10                         | 12                    | 30%                          |
| Phase Review              | 100                        | 3                     | 60%                          |
| Attendance/Participation  | 1                          | 15                    | 10%                          |
| **TOTAL**                 | –                          | –                     | **100%**                     |

### Grading
CIXD 3091/6012 relies on the following grading measures:
 
**Attendance/Participation** is evaluated per class according to the following point allocations:
+ 1 pt _	active (arrives on time and leaves with class dismissal, contributes to the class community and development, and demonstrates awareness/respect of self and others)
+ .5 pt _	distractive (arrives either late and/or leaves early and/or comes and goes, is not prepared for or involved in the class, or behaves in a way that takes away from the learning environment)
+ 0 pt _	absent
 
**Per Class Assignments** are evaluated according to the following point allocations:
+ 10 pts _ high pass (work exceeds both deliverable requirements and qualitative expectations)
+ 9 pts _   pass (work satisfies deliverable requirements and qualitative expectations)
+ 8 pts _   low pass (work is incomplete and/or needs improvement)
+ 0 pts _   no pass (no work is submitted)
 
Progress grades, at the end of the term, are averaged and converted to a 100-point scale for inclusion in the overall course grade.
 
**Phase Reviews** are measured via rubric according to the following 100-point scale:
 
+ A = exceptional/ masterful (94 to 100)
+ A- = excellent/ exceeds expectations (90 to less than 94)
+ B+ = very good/ well executed (87 to less than 90)
+ B = good/ satisfies requirements (84 to less than 87)
+ B- = low pass/ incomplete and/or uncertain performance (80 to less than 84)
+ C+ = unsatisfactory/ grossly incomplete and/or weak performance (77 to less than 80)
+ C = no pass/ minimal attempt made (74 to less than 77)
+ F = no attempt made (0 to less than 60)
 
Note: Evaluations of B-, C+, and C in multiple courses could result in academic probation.
 
Grades will be calculated to the tenth. The number in the tenth position will be rounded up if the number in the hundredth position is a 5 or greater. Grades will not be rounded up due to the number in the tenth position.

### Feedback 
Students will receive feedback regarding course/project progress in the form of either a qualitative or quantitative measure at regular intervals in the semester.

**Qualitative Feedback**
Students will receive qualitative feedback via:

+ *Desk critiques* - individual verbal assessments between a single student or small group of students and the instructor
+ *Informal pinups* - a forum for students to gain valuable verbal feedback from both peers and faculty during the development of a project
+ *Formal pinups* - juried reviews for project culminations

**Quantitative Feedback/Rubrics**
The GWU Corcoran Design Program relies on a template rubric for mile-marker assessment. The rubric is distributed to students before each mile-marker in order to establish performance expectations.

### Midterm Grades
Midterm grades will be issued in the 8th week of the semester. These grades will not be recorded formally; however, they provide faculty an opportunity to determine if a student is at risk of failing a class and to communicate any known issues to students. Students should take midterm grades seriously and develop an action plan with their instructor to improve any unsatisfactory trajectories. Low performing students must make the decision to withdraw from the course before the tenth week of class.

### General Attendance
Attendance is required at each class meeting and all course related activities. Class attendance will be strictly monitored. In the case of emergency or serious illness, students must notify the instructor in advance if unable to attend a session; or, students must submit a Doctor’s Note excusing the absence. An excused absence may be granted by the instructor in the instance of extreme need, but students still will be required to make-up work and assignments for any missed sessions.

**All students are permitted two total grace absences per semester–one that does not deduct from the participation grade. Any absence past the grace absences results in a half letter grade deduction from the final grade. Per GW policy, students who are absent for more than 25% of classes automatically fail the course.**

**Students who are both present and on-time for all classes will receive a full point added to their final grade.**
 
### Milemarker Attendance
Attendance/participation in mile-marker reviews is mandatory. Only in extreme circumstances (unpredictable and serious emergencies) will students be afforded some flexibility. All students who miss a mile-marker review must make arrangements with the instructor to submit to Blackboard the requirements of the review by a mutually agreed upon date. Any student who misses a mile-marker review without an acknowledged excuse will be evaluated on a 75/100 scale; any student who misses a mile-marker review with an acknowledged excuse will be evaluated on a 90/100 scale.

### Late Arrivals
Students are required to be on time for every class meeting. **Three late arrivals will result in the lowering of a student’s final grade by one full grade level; for example, an A will drop to an A-.**

### Incomplete/Late Work
Students have the opportunity to (re)submit incomplete or late weekly assignments up to two-weeks beyond the original deadline—for an evaluation of no greater than 9 pts after one week and no greater than 8 pts after two weeks. Weekly assignments that are submitted beyond two weeks past the original deadline will receive 0 pt for the original assignment, but will receive credit as part of any mile-marker reviews. Mile-marker reviews are the end-all deadlines for the weekly assignments that precede them; they may not be submitted late.

### Cell Phones and Social Media
Extra-curricular use of cell phones, texting, social networking online during class time is prohibited. **Students violating this policy will be asked to leave the class, noted as absent, and may have their grade lowered as a consequence.**

## Policies and Protocol

### Academic Integrity Code
Academic integrity is an essential part of the educational process, and all members of the GW community take these matters very seriously. As the instructor of record for this course, my role is to provide clear expectations and uphold them in all assessments. Violations of academic integrity occur when students fail to cite research sources properly, engage in unauthorized collaboration, falsify data, and otherwise violate the [Code of Academic Integrity](https://studentconduct.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity). If you have any questions about whether particular academic practices or resources are permitted, you should ask me for clarification. If you are reported for an academic integrity violation, you should contact Student Rights and Responsibilities (SRR) to learn more about your rights and options in the process. Consequences can range from failure of assignment to expulsion from the University and may include a transcript notation. For more information, refer to the SRR website at [studentconduct.gwu.edu/academic-integrity](studentconduct.gwu.edu/academic-integrity), email rights@gwu.edu, or call 202-994-6757.

### Office of Access and Opportunity (OAO)
GW is committed to maintaining a nondiscriminatory, harassment-free educational and work environment. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against or harassed based on a protected characteristic may submit a report via a centralized [Discrimination, Harassment, and Bias Reporting Form](https://click.gwu.edu/click/swnf7o/oti2t32/4pepfbc). Please note that all GW Community Members who become aware of a situation involving discrimination or harassment are responsible for promptly reporting the matter via the Report Form.

### Title IX Office
The George Washington University (GW) and its faculty are committed to creating a safe and open learning environment for all students. If you or someone you know has experienced any form of sexual harassment, including but not limited to, sexual assault, dating or domestic violence, or stalking, please know that help and support are available. GW strongly encourages all members of the community to take action, seek support, and report incidents of sexual harassment to the Title IX Office. You may contact the Title IX Office at 202-994-7434 or at titleix@gwu.edu or learn more by visiting [titleix.gwu.edu](titleix.gwu.edu). Please be aware that faculty members are required to disclose information about suspected or alleged sexual harassment or other potential violations of the Title IX Sexual Harassment and Related Conduct Policy to the Title IX Office. If the Title IX Office receives information about an incident, they will reach out to offer information about the resources, rights, and procedural options that are available to members of the campus community. Community members are not required to respond to this outreach. If you, or another student you know, wishes to speak to a confidential resource who does not have this reporting responsibility, please contact Counseling and Psychological Services through the Student Health Center 24/7 at 202-994-5300, or the Office Of Advocacy and Support at 202-994-0443 or oas@gwu.edu.

### University Policy on Observance of Religious Holidays
Students must notify faculty during the first week of the semester in which they are enrolled in the course, or as early as possible, but no later than three weeks prior to the absence, of their intention to be absent from class on their day(s) of religious observance. If the holiday falls within the first three weeks of class, the student must inform faculty in the first week of the semester. For details and policy, see [provost.gwu.edu/policies-procedures-and-guidelines](provost.gwu.edu/policies-procedures-and-guidelines).

### Use of Electronic Course Materials and Class Recordings
Students are encouraged to use electronic course materials, including recorded class sessions, for private personal use in connection with their academic program of study. Electronic course materials and recorded class sessions should not be shared or used for non-course related purposes unless express permission has been granted by the instructor. Students who impermissibly share any electronic course materials are subject to discipline under the Student Code of Conduct. Contact the instructor if you have questions regarding what constitutes permissible or impermissible use of electronic course materials and/or recorded class sessions. Contact Disability Support Services at [disabilitysupport.gwu.edu(disabilitysupport.gwu.edu)] if you have questions or need assistance in accessing electronic course materials.
 
### Use of Artificial Intelligence
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools are becoming important resources in many fields and industries. Accordingly, you are permitted to use the GW-approved tools (in this course we will primarily be using [Copilot](https://it.gwu.edu/microsoft-copilot) to generate content submitted for evaluation in this course, including text prompts and interpretive visuals. You remain responsible for all content you submit for evaluation. **For this class,** when using genAI, you are required to:

1.  Work out your ideas and prompts on paper BEFORE you start using AI. Document this pre-AI work in GitHub.
2. Document your text prompt or visual input in GitHub.
3. Document the raw output, and cite which tool and which model you used in GitHub. For example, text generated using Copilot should include a citation such as: “Copilot, GPT-5. (YYYY, Month DD of query). ‘Text of your query.’ Generated using Copilot. https://it.gwu.edu/microsoft-copilot.” Material generated using other tools should be cited accordingly. Failure to do so in this course constitutes failure to attribute under the George Washington University Code of Academic Integrity.
4. Submitted final work must transform the genAI output, and you must be prepared to discuss HOW the transformation significantly extends the AI output.
 
You may use GAI tools to research, to help generate ideas and to brainstorm. However, you should note that the material generated by these tools may be inaccurate, incomplete, or otherwise problematic. You are responsible for verifying and validating any content you generate using genAI. Beware that use may also stifle your own independent thinking and creativity. Vague prompts = vague results.

### Archiving 
The university reserves the right to retain student work for archival, educational, and marketing purposes. Projects/models, assignments, and exams will be kept at the department’s discretion. If a project is selected to be archived, it is the responsibility of the student to assist faculty in documentation and collection. Students will be awarded a final grade of ‘incomplete’ until archiving material is received.

## Academic Support

### Writing Center
Grammar and spelling set the first impression of a text. If a text is poorly written, its readers may never get past structural errors to appreciate the text’s argument or intentions. This class, however, is not organized to provide basic syntactical and lexical feedback. You will be marked down, but not corrected, for poor grammar and spelling; feedback will focus on narrative, structure, and tone. Students, in turn, are expected to submit writing that already is well-written. Students are encouraged to seek writing assistance from GWU’s Writing Center:
 
GW’s Writing Center cultivates confident writers in the University community by facilitating collaborative, critical, and inclusive conversations at all stages of the writing process. Working alongside peer mentors, writers develop strategies to write independently in academic and public settings. Appointments can be booked online at [gwu.mywconline](gwu.mywconline).

### Academic Commons
Academic Commons is the central location for academic support resources for GW students. To schedule a peer tutoring session for a variety of courses visit [go.gwu.edu/tutoring](go.gwu.edu/tutoring). And, visit [academiccommons.gwu.edu](academiccommons.gwu.edu) for study skills tips, finding help with research, and connecting with other campus resources. For questions email academiccommons@gwu.edu.

### Support for Students Outside the Classroom 
**Disability Support Services (DSS)** - 202-994-8250
Any student who may need an accommodation based on the potential impact of a disability should contact Disability Support Services at [disabilitysupport.gwu.edu](disabilitysupport.gwu.edu) to establish eligibility and to coordinate reasonable accommodations.

**Office of Advocacy and Support (OAS)**
