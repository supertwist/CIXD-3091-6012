## SEMESTER APPROACH TO THE COURSE
The world is expensive! We'll consider how to take advantage of limited available resources: constraints can supercharge creativity.

It's easy to fall into the same old routine and settle for obvious solutions. We'll develop skills that break you out of old, easy habits and assumptions that lead to more original solutions.
  
It's easy to design in the abstract, but coming up with solutions for REAL people is... messy! We'll develop client engagement skills by working on live projects with real clients and their stakeholders.

Clients don't want to just hear ideas, they want to see concrete things that can be poked, pushed, marked up, beat up, torn down, etc. We'll spend time in the fab lab broadening your skills at MAKING THINGS.

Everything comes to an end. What is the lifecycle of the thing you've made? Does it have a shelf life? What comes after? Rather than cradle-to-grave, we'll consider a cradle-to-cradle mindset that encourages sustainability.

## COURSE CONTENT
CIXD 3091/6012 covers:
+ How to think with your eyes and hands before you touch a computer.
+ How to play nice with others (collaborate with colleagues.)
+ How to create ORIGINAL work with genIA.
+ How to make things with LASERS!
+ How to 3D print things.
+ How to engage clients and pitch potential solutions.

## COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES
CIXD 3091/6012 satisfies the following GWU Corcoran Design Program learning outcomes:

**Creativity and Design Process** (CDP) - Students will create inventive and appropriate design solutions using a variety of approaches, knowledges, and skills—including intuition, ideation, iteration, reason, research, and strategy.

**Design Impact (IMP)** - Students will responsibly and respectfully engage communities/places and their histories in the process of developing design-based responses; they will assess design solutions with a focus on their environmental and social impacts over their lifecycle.

**Design Tools, Techniques, and Skills** (TTS) - Students will be proficient in design techniques/technologies and cultivate the capacity to build practical/technical skills as approaches/tools change.

**Professional Design Practices** (PDP) - Students will be aware of the approaches and strategies for building a sustainable creative practice; they will demonstrate design professionalism through effective communication, persuasive presentations, organizational understanding, design strategy, and self-reflective approaches to working with and guiding the work of others.

These learning outcomes are dimensions of every assignment, but particularly for out three client engagements - these client engagements are really the mile-markers. At the end of each engagement we’ll take some time in class to discuss how you performed own each of these dimensions. I’ll expect each of you to be able to speak articulately about how each of these outcomes was reflected in the project. So for example, on any client engagement, I might ask you:

+ What interesting things did you discover in your research that took you in an unexpected direction? (CDP)
+ Did you refine your solution such that it might be scaled sustainably? (IMP)
+ Did you bootstrap any new skills to pull off your prototype? (TTS)
+ How well did you ‘hear’ the stakeholders? In the final pitch, was there a disconnect? (PDP) 

You will be assessed by how well you can speak to each of those dimensions at the end of as project.

## STUDENT COMPETENCIES
By the end of CIXD 3091/6012 students will be able to:

+ Contribute to a GitHub repository
+ Build interactive wireframes in Figma
+ Prep files for laser engraving and cutting in Illustrator (we’ll touch on some more esoteric capabilities that aren’t covered in the basic laser training)
+ Use the 3D scanners
+ Create basic models for FDM printing Fusion 360
+ Prep files for FDM printing using Orca slicer (like the lasers, we’ll touch on some more esoteric capabilities that aren’t covered in the basic laser training)
+ Build useful prompts in Copilot
+ Capture useful info from stakeholders to solve problems 
+ Create compelling presentations that convey your solutions to clients

## ACTIVITIES, PROCESSES, AND ASSIGNMENTS
We’ll start the semester with some specific skill-building exercises (3D scanning, advanced 3D printing, advanced laser engraving and cutting). Then, we’re going to work on three live projects for real clients. Each of these will be three week sprints, where we exercise your skills such that you get progressively better through practice. By the third client project you’ll be much better at (for example) collecting stakeholder input than you were on the first client. 

Getting proficient (at anything) takes repeated practice over an extended period of time. If you sit on a rock long enough, it will hatch.
